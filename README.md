This is the final project for CMSC436 Programming Handhelp Systems at UMD. 
We were originally given a project description and title "Feed The Kitty" which adventually became Fat Cat. 
This app is written in Java for the Android platform by Andrew J, Brianne N, Eric G, Jacob E, Jasper L, and Stephen H.
