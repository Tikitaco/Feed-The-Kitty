This is the final project for CMSC436 Programming Handheld Systems at UMD. 
We were originally given a project titled "Feed The Kitty" and a short description of an application that would allow users to create events and split payments. Eventually this idea became "Fat Cat", an app that allows users to add friends, add bank accounts, view fund transfers, create events, and split costs. 

This app is written in Java for the Android platform by Andrew J, Brianne N, Eric G, Jacob E, Jasper L, and Stephen H.
